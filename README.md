Welcome to NapKim Math, where I break down games and data one napkin at a time! I turn gameplay into insights with spreadsheets and SQL, analyzing every move to find the hidden patterns. Whether I’m cleaning up messy data or making sense of complex strategies, there’s always something to crunch. Grab a coffee, pull up a napkin, and let’s dive in!
